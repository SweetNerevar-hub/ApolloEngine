Subject: Abstracting the window functionality

Nothing special with this commit, I just created a new Window class which will abstract out the SFML window creation and handle the settings for the window, like: getting and setting the window's size, toggling fullscreen, and toggling VSync, etc.
Having all this functionality within a dedicated Window class will make it much more extendable and clean when it comes to implementing things like Options Menus for games and so players can adjust the window settings as they like.
